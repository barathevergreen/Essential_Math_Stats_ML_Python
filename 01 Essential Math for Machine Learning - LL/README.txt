Quiver Plot and Scipy limits - to indicate vector directions in plot
magnitude using - np.linalg.norm(v)
degree theta - math.atan(vTan)
Different types of vector multiplication
Matrices - np.array and np.matrix, properties, np.linalg.inv
Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors - eVals, eVecs = np.linalg.eig(A)
Eigen Decomposition - A = QÎ»Q-1
Different types of charts - Bar, Pie, Line, Density Plots
Lines on Histograms to indicate Mean, Median, Mode - linestyle, linewidth
Percentile - scipy.stats.percentileofscore() - Weak and Strong percentiles
Data Comparison - Impact of Normalization
Conditional Probability
Binomial Theorem
Confidence Interval - ci = stats.norm.interval(0.95, m, sd)
